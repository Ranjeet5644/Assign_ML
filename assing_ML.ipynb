In supervised learning, the model learns to map inputs to the correct outputs by finding patterns in the labeled data. This type of learning is widely used when the goal is to make predictions or classify data based on previously seen examples."

    "Unsupervised learning is highly effective in anomaly detection, especially when labeled data for anomalies (outliers) is scarce or unavailable. In anomaly detection, the goal is to identify unusual data points, behaviors, or patterns that deviate from the norm. Here’s how unsupervised learning can be applied in this context:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clustering-Based Anomaly Detection:\n",
    "Method: Algorithms like K-means, DBSCAN, or Hierarchical Clustering group data points based on similarity. Once clusters are formed, points that don’t belong to any cluster or that are distant from the nearest cluster center are considered anomalies.\n",
    "Application: Useful in applications like fraud detection, where fraudulent activities might not conform to typical transaction patterns.\n",
    "2. Density-Based Anomaly Detection:\n",
    "Method: Density estimation techniques like Local Outlier Factor (LOF) estimate the density of points in the feature space. Points that lie in low-density regions, far from clusters of similar points, are flagged as anomalies.\n",
    "Application: Often used in network security, where abnormal network activity (e.g., a sudden spike in traffic) is rare compared to normal traffic.\n",
    "3. Reconstruction-Based Anomaly Detection:\n",
    "Method: Techniques like Autoencoders or Principal Component Analysis (PCA) learn a compressed representation of normal data. If a new data point cannot be accurately reconstructed by the model, it is likely an anomaly. This is because unusual data generally doesn’t match the patterns learned from normal data.\n",
    "Application: Used in manufacturing for equipment monitoring, where anomalies might indicate faults or wear and tear in machinery.\n"
